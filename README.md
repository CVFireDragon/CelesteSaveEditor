A simple Save Editor for Celeste

## The Story
I recently got the game Celeste, and I was wondering if you could edit the save. I googled "Celeste Save Editor" and found one on Patreon (closed source). So I opened my save in a hex editor, and I saw it was a simple XML file. So I wrote this text editor for editing celeste saves. Enjoy! :)
